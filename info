/// Initial Email for Project Suggestion


 Hi Cormac,

 Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.

 So my original idea for a 10-week project was that you might spend half this time developing
 your own python software to explore some aspect of the technique for detecting TeV (E>100 GeV) 
 gamma rays from astrophysical sources. Then the second half would involve using the in-house 
 VERITAS software to look at some real data recorded with the VERITAS telescope array.

 The project in this format I would now propose would be to explore the way we reject background 
 noise photons in our photomultiplier cameras. Then using that experience, see if you can improve 
 our analysis of VERITAS data that we recorded on a gamma-ray burst (GRB 20190114).

 I can't remember what I may have given you already but I'm attaching two papers that you can 
 take a look at. One describes the field of TeV astrophysics in general, and the other describes VERITAS.
 You can also get info about VERITAS at https://veritas.sao.arizona.edu/

 Stepping back for a moment, you may not wish to do quite this much work. Also - do your interests 
 lie more with astrophysics or with computational physics or both? Take a look at the papers and let i
 me know if you would like to proceed with the project outlined above or if you have any other ideas.

 Regards,
 Mark

 ps, I got a request from one of your classmates interested just in learning more coding over the i
 summer and here was my reply:

 You might find some ideas in a book I recommended when you were in 2nd year. There is a free pdf 
 available at https://www.compadre.org/osp/items/detail.cfm?ID=7375

 The examples are all in C++, but you could easily do them in Python. The early chapters are straight 
 forward, but there are many nice ideas and challenges in the later chapters. For example last year 
 one of the fourth years did a project on using the variational principle to solve the Schrodinger equation, 
 see section 16.7 of the book. Finding the higher energy solutions is an interesting challenge!

 I thought this book 
 https://www.amazon.com/Python-Scientists-John-M-Stewart-ebook/dp/B072LY85HL
 looked interesting, my copy is still in College. An eCopy is not too expensive and might be worth getting.

 If you wanted to try something more computer science focused, learn how to write "object-oriented" code 
 in python. We don't cover this in physics, but it is a very useful structure for very large programming projects. 
 (we use it in VERITAS). It's described in chapter 12 of "Python programming: an introduction to computer science" 
 by John Zelle. You should be able to find free pdfs of this book online.
